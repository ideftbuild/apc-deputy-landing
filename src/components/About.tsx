              My Story
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              From my earliest days, I have been driven by a passion for justice
              and a deep-seated belief in the power of community. My journey
              into law and politics was fueled by a desire to serve the people
              of Sierra Leone and to build a more equitable and prosperous
              future for all, especially the youth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              As a dedicated member of the APC party, I have consistently worked
              at the grassroots level, connecting with members, understanding
              their challenges, and advocating for their needs. This campaign is
              a continuation of that lifelong commitmentâ€”to be a servant leader
              who is accessible, accountable, and always ready to fight for our
              collective progress.

                My legal background provides me with the unique skills necessary
                to uphold our party's constitution, ensure administrative
                fairness, and navigate complex challenges with clarity and
                integrity. A strong party is built on a foundation of rules and
                respect for due process.
